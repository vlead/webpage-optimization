Assumption to run this scripts:
Firstly all the command line arguments should be passed with out any ambiguity.
You have already installed phantomjs.
You have downloaded yslow.js in current directory.
Script FulltestwithTapoutput.sh takes one command line arguments 'arg1'.

$FulltestwithTapoutput.sh arg1 

Here first argument "arg1" is the file containing all urls for which for we need to run 'phantomjs' tool. Each line of 'arg1' contains a url. For example look at the 'urls' file which contains url in each line of the file.
