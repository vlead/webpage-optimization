Objective
               Main ojective is to make virtual labs web pages fast and optimized which will lead to higher user visitor engagement,lesser rendering time and saving network bandwidth.

               Sometime lab developers during their coding time forget to follow performance best practices which leads to more rendering time,more bandwidth usage and lesser user experience.So as a part of testing framework,we have to develop a framework to analyze our web pages and optimize it also.

               After extreme reading  and research, we chose Yahoo Yslow and Google Pagespeed which will help us to collect report of aq website and also optimize it.

               Yslow uses yahoo best practices and generates scores for each url based on certain rules.It will give current status of a website and suggestion to improve it.    

               Pagespeed also follows performance best practices and it identifies best practices  that can be applied for the web page and optimizes the page with its custom filters.
