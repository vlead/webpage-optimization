* Data Visualization 
The data gathered in the csv files is used to derive proper statistics of the information. Bar graphs are genrated using Matplotlib 
and csvkit. The graphs for all the rules of yslow are generated automatically once the program is run. The csv files contain data listed 
in rows and columns. Each graph requires just a single column of data which is extracted using csvkit and then used to generate it.
The program runs iteratively over all the columns of the csv file.
