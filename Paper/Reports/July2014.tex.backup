In month of June we were working on collecting data on performance of 5000 web pages of www.vlab.co.in and later we thought of
doing analysis of web pages hosted at deploy.virtual-labs.ac.in. During last week of June Haeenf gave us a replica of deploy.virtual-labs.ac.in
on a container for collecting yslow reports. We wrote a script to collect yslow reports automatically in batches by multiple processes in
backround. We collected by all data by first week of July. Then we did analysis of data using visualization. Later we prsented our
work and it importance during Final Presentation by interns. During third wee, based on Dr. Venkatesh suggestion I collected data of pageload time
and correlated it with scores we obtained from yslow.  And from past couple of weeks I have been reading book on web performance optimization
and writing a proposal explaining why, how and what need to be done optimize performance of virtual labs. I also have been wiritng paper for T4E, 2014.
